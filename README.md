You’ll be creating the card and swapping out the fish with an animal of your choice.

## Project Instructions 

1. Have a look at the design-prototype.png. Note down what you notice about the styling or structure of the prototype.

2. Customize card.html

- Open card.html.
- Download your favorite animal's image.
- Replace the placeholder image with your favorite animal's image.
- Don't forget to change the image's alt attribute to the name of your animal. So, alt="name-of-your-animal" should be replaced with the actual name of your animal.
- Modify card.html to include attributes so that you can use CSS selectors to style the elements specified in the next step - Customize styles.css. Make sure you use meaningful names for CSS classes.
- Link your stylesheet in card.html or else your CSS, styles.css will not be applied to your webpage. You will not be including any <style> elements or style attributes in the body of card.html.
- Replace the current information with your animal's information. Information will refer to:
  - The Animal's Name
  - The Interesting Fact about the Animal
  - The List of Items for your Animal's Characteristics.
  - Your Animal's Brief Description.

3.  Customize styles.css

- For the image, you will want to use an image with a width of 300 pixels. If your image is larger, you can set the image's width to 300 pixels in your CSS
- The entire card's width should be fixed and include the spacing around the image (Since image is 300px wide, card should be 300px + spacing on either side.)
- Italicized text for the animal's interesting fact.
- Bold the Labels for the animals' list items (e.g. 'Habitat'). Note that you have to only bold the labels, not the entire list items.
- No dots for the animal's list items.
- Border around the animal name, image and it's information (interesting fact, list items, and description). Make sure you set the border-style, border-width and border-color. You can even do it in one line
- Spacing / Padding around the animal's name, image, the list of items and the information.
